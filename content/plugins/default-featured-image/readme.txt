== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= My chosen featured image doesn't show, why isn't it working? =

This plugin can't guarantee that it works. That depends on the themes. Still I want to know if it fails, so [contact me](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/default-featured-image)

= Which functions can I use to display the featured image? =
The plugin uses the default WordPress functions `the_post_thumbnail` or `get_the_post_thumbnail`. `has_post_thumbnail` will always return true. `get_post_thumbnail_id` will return the ID set on the post or the DFI you set.

= Can I exclude a page or give it a different image? =

yes. you can exclude all kinds of things with the [conditional tags](http://codex.wordpress.org/Conditional_Tags). A few examples which you can paste in your `functions.php`

**Dont use a featured image on page 5**

		function dfi_skip_page( $dfi_id ) {
			if ( is_single( 5 ) || get_the_ID() == 5 ) {
				return 0; // invalid id
			}
			return $dfi_id; // the original featured image id
		}
		add_filter('dfi_thumbnail_id', 'dfi_skip_page' );


**Use a different image on the "book" posttype. The ID of the image is 12**

		function dfi_posttype_book( $dfi_id ) {
			if ( is_singular( 'book' ) || get_post_type() == 'book' ) {
				return 12; // the image id
			}
			return $dfi_id; // the original featured image id
		}
		add_filter('dfi_thumbnail_id', 'dfi_posttype_book' );

**Use a different image on certain categories**

		function dfi_category( $dfi_id ) {
			if ( has_category( 'category-slug' ) ) {
				return 13; // the image id
			} else if ( has_category( 'other_category' ) ) {
				return 14; // the image id
			}
			return $dfi_id; // the original featured image id
		}
		add_filter('dfi_thumbnail_id', 'dfi_category' );

= Can I change the HTML of the image returned? =
yes you can with the filter `dfi_thumbnail_html`.

	function dfi_add_class($html, $post_id, $default_thumbnail_id, $size, $attr) {
		// add a class to the existing class list
		$attr['class'] .= ' my-class';

		return wp_get_attachment_image( $default_thumbnail_id, $size, false, $attr );
	}
	add_filter( 'dfi_thumbnail_html', 'dfi_add_class', 10, 5 );
